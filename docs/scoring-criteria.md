# Scoring Criteria and Timing Metrics

My application implements a comprehensive scoring system that evaluates candidates based on both the content of their responses and their response timing. This document details my scoring approach.

## Scoring Dimensions

I evaluate candidates across five key dimensions:

1. **Technical Acumen (1-10)**

   -  Evaluation of the candidate's technical skills and knowledge relevant to the position
   -  Assessment of accuracy, depth, and relevance of technical explanations
   -  Identification of any gaps or inconsistencies in technical knowledge

2. **Communication Skills (1-10)**

   -  Clarity, coherence, and effectiveness in conveying complex ideas
   -  Articulation and language proficiency
   -  Ability to explain technical concepts in an understandable manner

3. **Responsiveness & Agility (1-10)**

   -  Speed of response (based on timing metrics)
   -  Thoughtfulness despite time pressure
   -  Ability to think quickly and provide relevant answers

4. **Problem-Solving & Adaptability (1-10)**

   -  Approach to challenges presented in questions
   -  Ability to think on their feet
   -  How they handle follow-up questions and provide clarifications

5. **Cultural Fit & Soft Skills (1-10)**
   -  Interpersonal communication style
   -  Alignment with company values (as inferred from job description)
   -  Professional demeanor and attitude

## Timing Metrics Integration

Timing data is captured and integrated into the scoring process in several ways:

1. **Response Time Capture**

   -  I record the time between when a question is displayed and when the candidate is typing
   -  I also measure the total time taken to complete the response
   -  These metrics are stored with each message in the interview transcript

2. **Timing Analysis**

   -  Average response time across all questions
   -  Response time patterns (e.g., which types of questions took longer)
   -  Total interview duration

3. **Timing Impact on Scoring**
   -  Timing data directly influences the "Responsiveness & Agility" score
   -  I use a balanced approach that rewards quick thinking without penalizing thoughtful, comprehensive answers
   -  The AI evaluator is explicitly instructed to consider response timing in context of question complexity

## Scoring Algorithm

The scoring process follows these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**

   -  Complete interview transcript with all questions and answers
   -  Timing data for each response
   -  Job description and CV for context

2. **AI Evaluation**

   -  The AI analyzes the transcript with timing data
   -  Scores are assigned for each dimension on a 1-10 scale
   -  The AI provides specific evidence from the transcript to justify scores

3. **Overall Score Calculation**

   -  The overall score is a weighted average of the five dimensions
   -  The weighting can be adjusted based on job requirements

4. **Qualitative Assessment**
   -  Strengths (3-5 specific strengths with evidence)
   -  Areas for improvement (2-4 specific areas with evidence)
   -  Summary assessment of candidate suitability

## Score Presentation

The final score is presented in a clear, visual format:

1. **Numerical Scores**

   -  Individual dimension scores (1-10)
   -  Overall composite score
   -  Visual representation using progress bars

2. **Timing Metrics Display**

   -  Average response time
   -  Total interview duration

3. **Qualitative Feedback**
   -  list of strengths
   -  list of improvement areas
   -  Summary paragraph

This comprehensive scoring approach provides recruiters with both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights to make informed hiring decisions.
